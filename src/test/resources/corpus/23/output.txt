THEY SAY OPPOSITES ATTRACT. That rule certainly applies to Robin Standefer and Stephen Alesch, the dark-haired New Yorker and blond Californian behind the in-demand architecture-and-design firm Roman and Williams. In the case of these two former Hollywood-set maestros¡ªshe a production designer; he an art director¡ªtheir magnetic connection and cinematic sensibility have infused everything from the urban-chic cafeteria at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters to some of New York's handsomest hospitality spaces, like the weighty and weathered-looking Ace Hotel and The Standard hotel's glamorous, honey-toned Boom Boom Room. Their latest project is a 30-story hotel that's currently under construction in midtown Manhattan.
