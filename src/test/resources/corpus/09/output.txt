He said he would be back.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, that is. The actor turned California governor turned actor is starring in The Last Stand.

In 2003, when he put his career on hold to enter politics, Schwarzenegger was 55, an aging action star who was one of the biggest names in Hollywood. Today, he is 65, eligible for Medicare and one of the biggest question marks in town. Is he still a movie star, after a decade in which he filmed nothing but a couple of cameos in other people’s movies, or is The Last Stand, well, his last stand?

The past couple of years have been hard for Schwarzenegger. Term-limited out of the governorship and unable, thanks to his Austrian birth, to make the run for president that many say he would have liked to tackle, he instead spent much of the past year in the tabloid headlines. His marriage to newswoman Maria Shriver broke up upon her discovery of a long-ago affair between him and a former housekeeper, which had produced a son. If recent years have been hard on Schwarzenegger, it doesn’t show.

“I just got back from a one-week ski trip with my kids in Sun Valley,” he says in his still-thick Austrian accent. “Of course, kids try to out-ski you. It becomes a fierce competition. I can still do all that stuff. I feel great physically.”

So what is it like for a former Mr. Universe to turn 65?

“I can’t tell you about aging except that it sucks,” Schwarzenegger says. “I’m no different than you. We all look in the mirror and say, ‘What happened?’ You once had muscles and now, slowly, they’re deteriorating. If you do work out, you stay in shape and feel good. I feel good right now.”

The Last Stand casts Schwarzenegger as the sheriff of a small Arizona town who goes up against a vicious drug cartel. It has all the fisticuffs, gunplay and explosions that made him a worldwide box-office champion in the 1980s and ’90s.

It might be his comeback film, the actor says, but it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that he is back.

“It’s great to be back in a starring role,” he says. “As you remember, when I got into the governorship in 2003, I said, ‘I will go in and run the state for seven years. Then I will be back in the movie business.’ “I was a public servant for seven years,” he says. “Now I’m back to my regular life again.”

It remains to be seen, of course, whether his fan base is still there.

He eased back into show business with the help of his friend, Sylvester Stallone, who cast him in cameo roles in the surprise hit The Expendables (2010) and its 2012 sequel. He hasn’t starred in a movie since Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).

“This movie was a perfect test for me,” Schwarzenegger says, “because it required a lot of stunts and a lot of action and physical work. The director was a fanatic about seeing as much of me as possible. Only if I could have gotten killed, the stunt guys took over.”

The hot rumor has Schwarzenegger lined up for a new Terminator movie. He says that it isn’t true — yet.

“I love that character,” he says with a grin. “Give me a great script.”
