IN the film “Luv,” opening Jan. 18, an 11-year old boy learns some not-always-lovely life lessons from his paroled uncle on the streets of Baltimore. Its director, Sheldon Candis, 33, has learned a few lessons himself on the way to making his first feature, which had its premiere at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. A Baltimore native, Mr. Candis loosely based the film’s story, which he wrote with Justin Wilson, on childhood experiences with his own uncle: riding around late at night in his car and listening to his advice on how to be a man. His possible criminal connections weren’t an issue. The fictionalized version goes deeper, exploring what happens when role models exhibit less than model behavior.

His lead characters, and their actors, give the film its emotional center: Uncle Vincent, played by the rapper Common, and his nephew Woody, portrayed by the up-and-comer Michael Rainey Jr., then 10. “I always say Michael is an alien,” Mr. Candis said. “He’s not from this world.”

Mr. Candis received a degree from the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and spent time working on film sets before meeting Mr. Wilson, his writing partner, and drafting a screenplay. Mr. Candis was able to get his film off the ground when his producer, Jason Berman, landed him a meeting with fellow Baltimore native Charles S. Dutton. It turned out that Mr. Dutton knew members of Mr. Candis’s family and became the first actor to sign onto the project. “Luv” was further developed with the help of Film Independent, which provides resources to filmmakers. During a recent interview, an upbeat Mr. Candis spoke with Mekado Murphy about managing Common and the movie’s long gestation. These are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Tell me a little about your experience with your uncle.

A. I looked up to him. He was the greatest male figure in my life at the time. And while he had this infamous reputation on the streets of Baltimore, I never witnessed any of that. And many of the life lessons he had passed on to me are still with me to this day.

Q. Did you find out more about him before writing the script?

A. I spoke with Ed Burns, former Baltimore police detective [and David Simon’s writing partner on the television series “The Wire”]. He shared all these details with me, things I never knew. He said: “You have to understand something. Your uncle was the great manipulator. He could use anything or anyone to get what he wanted. So if you’re telling me you spent those long nights in his car, it makes me believe, if he was transporting drugs, and a police officer passed the two of you, he wouldn’t look suspicious.”

Q. How do you see your film?

A. For me it’s about boys searching for their fathers. One of the main themes of the film is owners versus renters. It’s not necessarily taking ownership of material things, but taking ownership of one’s life.

Q. How long did the process take from development to a finished movie?

A. It took us eight years: three years of writing and rewriting and another five of just trying to find the financing and get the script out to actors.

Q. What were your techniques for directing Common?

A. I always connected with him on a very emotional level. What I did with him, and he doesn’t know it to this day, was I took on the nature and the qualities of his younger brother looking to him for guidance. It was a psychological thing to do with him, to come to him as my elder.

Q. Was it a goal to give people from minorities more opportunities in film?

A. I thought, if I have an opportunity, why don’t I empower not only black people, but the minority, the less given to? Therefore I wanted to go back home to Baltimore and empower my community. That’s a part of what I want my life’s existence to be.
