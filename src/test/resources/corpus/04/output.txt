 IN “Broken City,” a crime thriller by the director Allen Hughes, Mark Wahlberg plays Billy Taggart, a former New York policeman who suspects that his girlfriend (Natalie Martinez) is having an affair. Enraged, Billy gets so drunk that he hears the chorus of DMX’s “Party Up” thumping in his ears, then goes completely bananas on the streets of the East Village.

Russell Crowe, in scarf, and the director Allen Hughes on the set of “Broken City,” a crime drama about New York City politics that opens on Friday.

Rather than choreograph any of the cinematic mayhem in advance — there was no time for that, it seems, or desire — Mr. Wahlberg improvised. He told a couple of friends to stand on a street and then, with cameras rolling, began punching them. He ripped grates off storefronts, tossed garbage cans, yelled rude things at passers-by. Mr. Wahlberg capped off his bravura performance by hurling a 40-ounce bottle of beer at a friend’s Cadillac Escalade.

“Mark Wahlberg went through the East Village like King Kong,” Mr. Hughes said. “The cops finally came and shut us down.”

As Mr. Wahlberg remembers it: “It was such a pivotal moment in the movie, and we didn’t have a lot of time to get it, so I thought, let’s just go out there and do it for real. I had to call the mayor’s office to apologize, because they wanted to pull our permits.”

The scene comes about midway through the movie, at which point Mr. Wahlberg’s troubled character has done, one suspects, far more unsavory things. The crazy part? Billy Taggart is the good guy. “Broken City,” which opens on Friday, pits Mr. Wahlberg against Russell Crowe, who plays a smirking, reptilian New York City mayor who hires Billy to spy on his supposedly adulterous wife, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Of course, this being a thriller, what you thought you saw happening really wasn’t, and that guy you thought was doing one thing was actually doing something else entirely.

“Broken City” is the first feature film that Mr. Hughes, 40, has directed without his twin brother, Albert, who has been living in the Czech Republic since 2004. During the past two decades the Hughes Brothers, sons of an African-American father and an Armenian-American mother, have been inseparable, professionally speaking, jointly directing five films, including “Menace II Society,” “Dead Presidents,” “From Hell” and “American Pimp.” Both siblings, however, pursued solo projects after completing “The Book of Eli,” starring Denzel Washington, in 2010. “I think the relationship is just much more complex now than it used to be,” Albert said by phone from his home in Prague. “We love each other, and in the end we’re still the best of friends.” When stressful things happen, he added, “we’re the only people we’re going to call, but we’re kind of in a weird dance right now.”

Going solo has had its downsides, Allen said. “The issue is learning that you’re going to be in a room sometimes, and there’s going to be eight guys assaulting you, creatively,” he explained. “Back in the day, when it was me and him, they could have had 15 people in the room, and they were all getting laid out.”

Allen sat at his favorite table at the Palm restaurant in West Hollywood, holding forth on everything from his early friendship with the rapper Eazy-E, who died in 1995, to the beat down he received in 1993 from about a dozen Crips, supposedly at the behest of Tupac Shakur. During a three-hour conversation Allen spent more time talking about why he hated Hollywood (lots of jackals, not many lions) than he did discussing his own career. He was funny and self-effacing, quick to cite what he considered the shortcomings of his feature films (“I don’t like any of ’em”) and his personal life (“I’ve been celibate for over a year”).

At the same table in 2010 Allen first met the writer of “Broken City,” whose script endured a long stint in development hell and a spot on Hollywood’s so-called black list, an honor roll of the industry’s best, albeit unproduced, screenplays. Allen liked the story, the language, the political intrigue, the Scotch. “I told my agent, ‘I can’t wait to meet this 58-year-old white man,’ ” he said.

Enter the screenwriter, Brian Tucker: African-American, Juilliard-educated, 27. “I’m looking at him like, ‘You’ve got the wrong table,’ ” Allen recalled.

Of their initial meeting Mr. Tucker said: “I think he thought I was one of those fellows who comes and asks for advice for their budding movie career. I think he was preparing to politely dismiss me.”

But the two quickly got on. “He said, ‘Look, if you’re with this, I promise that I’m going to get this movie made, and that it will be my next movie,’ ” Mr. Tucker recounted. “ ‘I’m going to have a chair next to mine with your name on it, and it’s going to be there every day.’ I had never been to a movie set, let alone had my own chair.”

Completed early last year, “Broken City” opens 20 years after the first Hughes brothers film, the acclaimed “Menace II Society.” The brothers, who directed “Menace” together when they were 20, had been making movies steadily since they were 12, with the help of two VHS machines and a video camera purchased by their mother, Aida.

“I did worry sometimes when they were teenagers,” Aida Hughes said. “I thought: ‘Oh my God, they’re going to be bums. All they want to do is watch movies, and make movies.’ ”

The film made instant stars of its young directors. “There was an urgency, an uneasiness about the movie, because you never knew who was going to get popped next,” Albert said. “It’s almost like ‘The Godfather’ in that way. We were really close in age to the guys we were portraying, and we were angry at the time too, so I think all that youthful, angry energy and uneasiness came through.”

At first blush the two films bookending this 20-year run — the first a cynical, straightforward tale of black teenagers fighting and dying on the streets of Los Angeles, the most recent a twisting, turning crime drama about New York City politics — would seem to have just about nothing in common. But a closer look reveals all sorts of similarities. Both films feature protagonists done in by bad circumstances and even worse anger-management skills; both employ great tunes at the sketchiest of moments (in “Menace” Samuel L. Jackson is grooving to Jerry Butler’s “Only the Strong Survive” just before he fires eight rounds into a friend’s chest); both concern videotapes of violent events best left unseen.

And both films reflect Allen’s lifelong fascination with charming rogues. In “Menace” it’s the homicidal O-Dog; in the documentary “American Pimp” it’s just about the entire cast; in “Broken City” it’s Mr. Crowe’s wily mayor. “I came up in Detroit and Pomona, where I would sneak out and hang out with drug dealers, winos, degenerates, street hustlers,” Allen said. “As far back as 5 years old I had a fascination with what I would call ‘stars,’ ‘charismatics.’ Look at ‘Menace.’ Without O-Dog you don’t really have a movie.”

Two decades in, “Menace” has endured, but Allen couldn’t recall the last time he had seen it. “I think when we were younger, when we used to smoke weed, I might have seen it right after it came out,” he said. “You smoke a joint, you go, ‘All right, I’m in a zone where I can handle this right now.’ ”

With “Broken City” Allen said he didn’t need help making it through a screening. “I don’t have any ‘ouch’ moments when I watch it,” he said. “There’s some things that bother me, but I know that every one of those actors showed up.”

“It’s a more mature version of ‘Menace,’ ” he continued. “With this one it’s like a boxer getting older and learning how to jab and get into a rhythm. You can play more, stretch out those feelings more. ‘Menace’ was what it was. It was kids making a movie about kids.”
