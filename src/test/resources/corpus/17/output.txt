McIlroy stirs up Ryder Cup debate January 13, 2013 -- Updated 2117 GMT (0517 HKT) Rory McIlroy, right, talks with his then Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie before Europe's 2010 victory in Wales. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Rory McIlroy says Colin Montgomerie should not return as European Ryder Cup captain World No. 1 backs Irishman Paul McGinley to step up from vice-captaincy role The 23-year-old Northern Irishman says the skipper's job should be a "one-time thing" European captain will be named on Tuesday ahead of Abu Dhabi tournament (CNN) -- While the sporting world awaits confirmation of his mega-money new sponsorship deal with Nike, Rory McIlroy has deflected attention to one of the other big stories on golf's horizon this week -- the naming of the next European Ryder Cup captain. The world No. 1 was part of last year's winning team, famously triumphing in his final-day singles match after needing a police escort to get to the Medinah course on time. Jose Maria Olazabal stood down after guiding the Europeans to a remarkable come-from-behind win over the U.S. -- and his assistants Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley were initially frontrunners for the 2014 role at Gleneagles in Scotland. However, that changed when the Americans turned once again to Tom Watson , the last U.S. captain to triumph on European soil in 1993 and who won four of his eight major titles at Scottish links courses. Tiger Woods, right, congratulates Rory McIlroy after Europe's remarkable victory over the U.S. on the final day of the 2012 Ryder Cup in September. The two are big rivals on the golf course, but a friendship has also blossomed this year. Golf great Nick Faldo has questioned whether they should be so close. Sports psychologist Dan Abrahams says they would benefit from keeping a bit of distance. "In the heat of battle it becomes more difficult to emotionally detach yourself from that person's performance if you're good friends with that person," he told CNN. McIlroy has admitted idolizing Woods as a boy, but has now usurped him as golf's No. 1. "Once they step on the first tee, those competitive juices are flowing and they're focused either on their own game or beating each other," Abrahams said. They are following in golf's great tradition of rivalries -- most notably Jack Nicklaus, left, and Arnold Palmer. "The power of the mind and the capability of that mental discipline is what separates the good from the great," sports leadership expert Khoi Tu told CNN. "That might allow them to become friends with people off the course, but not on the course." Formula One's greatest rivalry was between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. "They absolutely detested each other," Tu says. "They were two very different personalities, and often that's one of the features of great sporting rivalries: Fire and ice." Fernando Alonso, left, has now twice been beaten to the F1 championship by Sebastian Vettel -- who is widely rumored to be his teammate at Ferrari come 2014. "When you get two No. 1 drivers together with no team rules, then the sparks can really fly," Tu says. "It's rare for them to be good mates. They may get along, they may trust and respect each other in a professional capacity, but hanging out is a different issue." Former world champion Jackie Stewart, seen here playing with the children of F1 rival Graham Hill, was remarkably friendly with his peers, Tu says. "He was incredibly fond of a number of people who drove with him. That partly is because there was a clearer distinction of him being a number one and them being number two drivers." A new rivalry has grown in tennis this year between U.S. Open and Olympic champion Andy Murray, left, and childhood friend Novak Djokovic, the world No. 1. "People say that Murray and Djokovic are close but I think it's rare," Tu says. "The best sporting rivalries are the ones where there are these very distinct, almost opposite personalities, but they're very close in terms of their competence." Rafael Nadal, left, ended the tennis dominance of Roger Federer but they have publicly expressed their friendship despite reports of arguments about on-tour issues. "As people get older they've done so much, broken lots of records, I think that competitive edge is slightly dulled," Tu says. "That makes it easier to be friendlier. You can keep your dignity if you're not crying every time you lose to a younger, faster athlete." Martina Navratilova, left, and Chris Evert had one of the biggest rivalries in women's tennis. "They ended up as good buddies, but that was when the battling had been done," Tu says. "All of the respect and friendship you get in sport comes through competence first -- ' I know how hard it is to be this good, so I respect them for that.' " Fiery American John McEnroe, left, and ice-cool Swede Bjorn Borg created an iconic tennis rivalry. "When those two collided, at the height of tennis perfection, that's when the audience is really enthused and enthralled," Tu says. "To get that rivalry, they have to leave any friendship on the sidelines." Sometimes you get two great athletes, but they are too close to be proper rivals -- such as tennis star Serena Williams, left, and her sister Venus. "The great things about sport is the sense of competition, the uncertainty of the outcome, the fairness of the playing field," Tu says. "You might be able to suspend enough of your fraternal or sisterly love to play a decent game of tennis but it won't reach the heights of the rivalries that make the sport." Muhammad Ali, left, "demonized" Joe Frazier to hype up their fights despite being showed respect outside the ring by his rival. "He came up with the gorilla term to create a spectacle, which he knew was important, but it revved himself up too," Tu says. "He needed to have a real enemy. By the end of the (Manila) fight, he said that Frazier brought out the best of him." Then there's modern football's greatest rivalry -- Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. "I'm not sure Messi is a rival with anyone, he still has that unique joy of just playing," Tu says. "But I think with Ronaldo, the truth is Messi is his nemesis -- and the fact that Messi doesn't care makes it even worse."

Joy for Johnson >> PGA Tour's 2013 opener hit by winds Miguel Angel Jimenez celebrates with a glass of red wine and a cigar after becoming the European Tour's oldest winner with victory at the age of 48 in November's Hong Kong Open. Jimenez and Ryder Cup teammate Lee Westwood toast Europe's victory in the 2010 event at Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales. Jimenez sprays Jose Manuel Lara of Spain with champagne after his compatriot wins the 2010 Austrian Open. Jimenez, puffing a trademark cigar, celebrates after winning the French Open in July 2010. 2010 was a big year for Jimenez, who won the first of three titles that season at the Dubai Desert Classic in February. Jimenez with ex-wife Monserrat after winning the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship event in 2008. He won the Hong Kong Open for the second time in 2007, having also triumphed at Fanling three years previously. Jimenez won five tournaments in 2004, the last of which was the BMW International Open in Munich, Germany. In 1997 Jimenez was assistant to team captain Seve Ballesteros as Europe retained the Ryder Cup at Spain's Valderrama Golf Club -- the first time it had been played outside of the U.S. and the UK. His 1994 triumph at the Dutch Open was his second of 19 titles so far on the European Tour, having won his first in Belgium two years earlier. Oldest winner >> Jimenez: Golf's great celebrater Since then Colin Montgomerie has been widely tipped to repeat his 2010 role, when Europe won at Celtic Manor, and the eight-time European Tour money list winner confirmed last week that he would be interested in the leading the team in his home country. Read: Jamieson climbs out of 'abyss' to live the dream "I thought it was between Darren and Paul until Darren said something, then my name was mentioned," Montgomerie said ahead of the Volvo Champions event in South Africa, where he finished 18 shots behind Sunday's victor Louis Oosthuizen. "I've never canvassed, as I didn't last time. I've not spoken to anybody about this. But I've always felt that if I was asked I would do it and that's still the case." However, McIlroy -- who played under Montgomerie -- has firm opinions about who should be captain. "Ryder Cup captaincy should be a 1-time thing," the Northern Irishman said on his Twitter page. "Everybody deserving gets their chance and moves on. Would love to play under Paul McGinley in '14." Bernard Gallacher, the last man to captain Europe more than once, agreed that Montgomerie should not return. "Colin said himself, when he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame, he intends to compete on the American seniors tour the moment he turns 50 this summer," the 63-year-old, who was skipper in 1991, '93 and '95, told the Scottish Daily Record newspaper. "So he will very quickly become out of touch with the players on the main tour. What message would that send to the other worthy candidates who are queuing up for the job, having earned their right to the captaincy just as much as Colin?"

Noodle delight Another brick in the Wall Wall chart >> China's crazy fantasy golf course Rory McIlroy capped a sensational year with victory at the Dubai World Championship on Sunday. The Northern Irishman won five tournaments in 2012, including his second major, topped the money list on both the PGA and European Tours and ended the season as the world's No. 1 player. After a solid start to the season McIlroy's year took off with victory at the Honda Classic in March. By holding off a chasing pack that included Tiger Woods and Keegan Bradley, the 23-year-old became world No. 1 for the first time in his career. After a mid-season slump, McIlroy roared back to form with an eight-shot victory at the PGA Championship to seal his second major triumph. It was the biggest winning margin in majors history, as he took the record from Jack Nicklaus -- the game's greatest ever player. McIlroy was almost unstoppable now as he secured victory at the Deutsche Bank Championship to take the lead in the PGA Tour's Fed Ex Cup -- the finale to their regular season. The following week the 23-year-old was in the winner's circle again, this time taking top honors at the BMW Championship. He became the first player to record back to back victories on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods in 2009. McIlroy's friendship with Tiger Woods blossomed during the 2012 season. The two even took each other on at an exhibition tournament in China in front of a huge crowd. McIlroy won by one shot. Both players reportedly shared $3 million for taking part. If McIlroy was on song in the individual stakes, he more than played his part in Europe's stunning comeback to win the Ryder Cup at Medinah in Chicago. McIlroy nearly forfeited his singles match by missing the start due to confusion over time zones, but earned a vital point for his side by beating Keegan Bradley as Europe eventually came back from 10-6 down to win 14 1/2 to 13 1/2. McIlroy was watched every step of the way in Dubai by his girlfriend -- tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. Icing on the cake >> McIlroy on top of the world Paul Lawrie, who tied for seventh at Durban Country Club on Sunday, has also spoken out against the chances of his compatriot Montgomerie. "He's had his go. One time job for me," the 1999 British Open champion wrote on Twitter. However, fellow professional Henrik Stenson, who was on the committee that first appointed Montgomerie, said the 49-year-old might yet be picked again on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. "No-one would question his passion for the Ryder Cup and the effort he put into the captaincy in 2010 and I am sure he would do the same and maybe more this time around if he was to be asked. So that might be a possible scenario," the Swede told the Scotsman newspaper. Olazabal, who finished joint last in the 33-man Volvo Champions tournament, said he would not be interested in taking the job again. "First of all it's a lot of energy and time, a huge demand and the pressure is quite big," the Spaniard told the UK Press Association. "Even if it was held in Spain again somewhere down the line I wouldn't do it. Monty has also done it and was successful too. If I was him I wouldn't do it again, but Monty is his own man. "I am a strong believer that we have a generation of players that deserve the captaincy -- and some might miss out because there are just too many. I think it's right to give those guys a chance." 
The debate, which comes ahead of this week's Abu Dhabi Championship featuring McIlroy and Tiger Woods, has taken some of the attention off Oosthuizen's remarkable come-from-behind victory in Durban.

The South African has risen to a career-high fourth in the world rankings after wiping out Scott Jamieson's five-shot lead within the first 11 holes of the final round.

The 2010 British Open champion shot six-under-par 66 to win by one stroke, denying the Scot his second win in the city in the space of a month.

It was his sixth victory on the European Tour, lifting him up to second in the Race to Dubai standings behind world No. 100 Jamieson, and his seventh top-10 finish in his last eight starts.

"It's a great start to the year, I knew I had to come out and get my name up there," the 30-year-old said.

Jamieson, who won the Nelson Mandela Championship in December to qualify for the limited field, almost forced a playoff when his eagle chip attempt at the last hole stopped just short of the hole.

"Louis's a major champion -- there's no shame in losing to him," the 29-year-old said.

Meanwhile, rookies Russell Henley and Scott Langley took a three-shot lead into the final round of the PGA Tour's Sony Open in Hawaii on Sunday.

The Americans were being chased by South African Tim Clark, while another newcomer -- Australian Scott Gardiner -- was tied for fourth with U.S. tour stalwart Charles Howell.
